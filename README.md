# Vehicle-Detection-Yolov8-and-ByteTracker-
Vehicle Detection and Counting Used YOLOv8 to detect and count incoming and outgoing vehicles through the line. This is a personal project which is still under development to produce better and more accurate results. The current Output Video is satisfactory but can be improved.

You can obtain the Test Video.mp4 from my kaggle dataset, you can also view the Output video generated after running the code.
